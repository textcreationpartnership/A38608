1. NEW OBSERVATIONS Upon the CREED.

    _ Of the Knowledge of God.

      * Why a man that ſhould be perfect, may always increaſe in Knowledge, but not in Goodneſſe.

      * To love God without knowing him, is the most irregular of all affections.

      * Why the wiſeſt Nations have had more paltry or horrible Gods then thoſe that were barbarous.

      * Queſt. Whether it be a ſufficient reaſon for adhering to a Religion, to alleadge that in it may be ſound ſalvation.

      * Such as a man is in his own nature, ſuch he imagineth that God is. Strange horrid conceits of the ſpirit of man concerning this ſubject.

      * Of all the Attributes of God, which is that which we ſee firſt? And which is that which we ſee leaſt?

      * The two greateſt points of Religion.

      * Which are more culpable, thoſe who diſtruſt the Power of God, or thoſe that doubt of his Mercy toward them?

      * The extent of Faith, and the diverſity of the objects of it.

      * Three degrees of language of God in the Creation.

      * Why God never ſpeaketh of himſelf in the Plural number, nor is ever brought in as conſulting, but where it concerneth man.

      * The diverſity of habitation which God hath given to two kindes of creatures which bear his image; that is, to Angels and Men.

      * What ought to be gathered from this, That God impoſed names upon the day, the night, the heavens, the earth, the ſea; yet hath given no general name to ſignifie the whole world.

      * Whence cometh it, that the ſpirit of man is pleaſed with variety?

      * Why the Scripture oftener nameth the Hand or the Arm of God, then the Heart of God.

      * Of the fundamental Law of the Creation, and of the excellent inſtructions which iſſue from it.

      * How many times the general order of the world hath been interrupted ſince the Creation.

      * An example of inſtructions wherewith the Providence of God hath furniſhed man, by creatures moſt contemptible.

      * Whence cometh it, that in divers diſputes and dialogues which we read to have paſſed between God and man, it ſeemeth (without blaſphemy be it ſpoken) that man reaſoneth better then God himſelf.

      * Notable examples of the Providence of God, in the Fatalities of Times, of Places, and other circumſtances.

      * Of many kindes of ſcourges equally dreadful and unavoidable, which ought to be choſen, if God ſhould leave the choice to us? or, which is more to be deſired?

      * Whence cometh it that among publike ſcourges, thoſe that paſſe the hand of men, are more frequent, more univerſal, and of longer durance, then thoſe which come immediately from God?

      * It maketh for the glory of God, that there be more wicked then good men.

      * The greateſt good that God hath done to the world, is come to paſſe by means of the greateſt crime that men could commit.

      * Nature it ſelf hath reſtrained the forces and ability of man, to the end to bound his deſires, and the effects of his malice.

      * Of the marvellous Providence of God permitting that the righteous die by the hand of the wicked.

      * Why in War the people of God have been often beaten by their enemies; and why a good cauſe hath been overthrown.

      * Why God never ſent above one Angel, or two at moſt, when he intended to destroy men; and hath often ſent many, when he intended to preſerve one man.

      * If man had perſevered in original juſtice, there had never been Miracles, but onely of one kinde.

      * A conſideration of the divers Names and Titles of our Saviour: And the differences that ought to be obſerved in expreſsing them.

      * Wherefore Jeſus, who received the Sacraments as well of the one as the other Teſtament, had not that external Anointing which was given to Prophets, Prieſts and Kings.

      * Whence cometh it that divers diſcourſes uttered by Jeſus Chriſt, ſeem to be without method? And an admirable ſecret, which ought to be obſerved.

      * A conjecture of what our Lord wrote, when the Phariſees demanded his judgement touching the puniſhment of the adultereſſe, Joh. 8.

      * Why God ſent for the forerunner of his Son, a Prophet rather then a King: And why there was no Chriſtian King for the ſpace of three hundred yeers after the nativity of Jeſus Chriſt.

      * An excellent gradation in the four Evangeliſts deſcribing the Genealogi• of Jeſus Chriſt.

      * Why the Scripture giveth the name of Antichriſt to him that denieth the Humanity of our Saviour, rather then to him that denieth his Divinity.

      * Why Jeſus Chriſt, after his reſurrection, called himſelf no more the Son of man, as before-times.

      * Why the moſt glorious miracles which our Lord wrought, were often preceded by ſome action which witneſſed thoſe weakneſſes to which his humane nature was made ſubject.

      * Of an admirable harmony which is found between the three periods of the three fourteens numbred in the firſt chapter of Saint Matthew.

      * Of the ſervice which the Angels have done to the Son of God, from his manifeſtation in the fleſh, until his Aſcenſion.

      * Of the advantage of the New Teſtament above the Old, in regard of the number of perſons which have had the gift of Miracles.

      * Wherefore till the coming of the Son of God, there have paſſed many ages without that any perſon hath had the gift of Miracles.

      * Why none of them from whom Chriſt is deſcended according to the fleſh, hath had the gift of Miracles.

      * Why John the Baptiſt had not the gift of Miracles.

      * Of the divers degrees or ſteps by which our Lord diſplayed his miraculous power toward the bodies of men.

      * Of the divers actions which Jeſus Chriſt hath done in the Temple of Jeruſalem.

      * Why no man ever wrought Miracle within the Temple of God, except the Son of God. An obſervation upon this ſubject.

      * Why the fear of death was more excuſable in the Saints of the Old Teſtament, then it is now: And why we ought not to imitate them in all that which have ſpoken concerning this ſubject.

      * An obſervation upon the words of the Apoſtle, Rom. 10.6, 7. forbidding to ask who ſhall aſcend into heaven, or who ſhall deſcend into the abyſſe?
