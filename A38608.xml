            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the greateſt cheats of this Age, is the multitude of Books which are written concerning matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For the most part, either they contain abundance of Leaves, and little fruit; or elſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb facs="tcp:100596:5"/>nothing but what hath been written a thouſand and a thouſand times before. In vain it is allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that nothing can be ſaid but what hath been ſaid already: For either this Maxime is true or falſe. If it be true, To what purpoſe is it to write what is not new? If it be falſe, as certainly it is, there is ſo much the leſſe reaſon to write that which is old, and known of all; there being ſo many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſubjects as yet not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>Now I well know that I expoſe my ſelf to the cenſure of many. One will tax the Title as proud and arrogant: To whom I content my ſelf to anſwer, That the ſame is found affixed to the Frontiſpice of
<pb facs="tcp:100596:5"/>other Writings by their Authours, whoſe modestie is ſufficiently known.</p>
            <p>Another will ſay, That, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Proteſtation, I ſpeak ſometimes that which ſome other hath already ſpoken. But if I mention it, this is onely by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and to fill up what others have left empty. For the rest, if it be found (which I know not) that ſome one hath prevented me in any paſſage, I ſhall always quit the right of Elderſhip to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it appertaineth. And in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of theſe Obſervations, what is mine may be eaſily diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from that which may have been anothers.</p>
            <p>Another, quite contrary, will
<pb facs="tcp:100596:6"/>blame them for their Novelty. And of a truth, thoſe that write no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they borrow of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have an advantage which I have not: For either they paſſe without contradiction, or at a need they have for their defenders the ſame Authours from whom they have begged their Writings; whereas I remain ſolely reſponſible for mine. But by how much the more theſe Obſervations ſhall be new to any one, ſo much the more ought he to bring adviſedneſſe and circumſpection to the cenſure of them.</p>
            <p>Another will ſay, That they ſerve not to Edification, That they are Subtilties. But it cannot be ſaid with leſſe then Blaſphemy, That
<pb facs="tcp:100596:6"/>divine Truths ſerve not to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Thoſe that I publiſh here, ſhall be ſufficiently upheld, as built upon the Rock. And in caſe there ſhould be found ſome one not yet well digeſted, the entire Body of the Work ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as deformed, no more then the face for a little Wart. Over and above, I do not thrust my ſelf in to turn over the leaves of the Book of Life; nor have I ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Queſtions heightned above that which the Scripture hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, to affect the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſublime ſpirit. On the the contrary, I have choſen the moſt common ſubject, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another will object, That theſe
<pb facs="tcp:100596:7"/>matters are too high for a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm. But is there any thing more high then the Mystery of the Trinity? And nevertheleſſe it is handled in the Catechiſm. Thoſe to whom I preached theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, know that in uttering them I rendered them ſufficiently popular and intelligible.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, after this Treatiſe upon the <hi>CREED,</hi> I hope to publiſh ſucceſſively that which I have alſo noted upon the <hi>DECA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGUE,</hi> upon the <hi>PRAYER,</hi> and upon the Doctrine of the <hi>SACRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS;</hi> and in theſe four Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to comprehend all the New Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which I have made upon the Catechiſm.</p>

Thoſe to whom they gave the name of Barbarians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored the Sun and the Moon: this was the moſt ſpecious Idolatry of any.

                  </head>
                  <p>All the enquiry which many men make, when a Religion is in diſpute, is onely to ask if in it a man may be ſaved. It is of no importance that there are falſhoods in their Religion, provided, ſay they, that they may work out their ſalvation. I ſpeak not here, whether they have any good ground for their opinion, to think to be ſaved in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in which themſelves know that there are falſhoods. But ſuppoſing that ſuch a crime hindereth not their ſalvation, ſurely it is incompatible with the honour and love which we owe to the Author of ſalvation, who abhorreth whatſoever is falſe in matter of his ſervice. It is an horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, and a mad ingratitude, to be well contented that God be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, and that by our ſelves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that we may be ſaved. Again,

                  <p>There is not a man, if you conſider him onely under the dictate of his own nature, which doth not figure God unto himſelf quite other then he is. All men conceive a God like unto themſelves, that is to ſay, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their humours and inclinations, or imagine that he ought to be ſo.

Hardly could we believe that man could be capable of ſo prodigious a madneſſe, if God himſelf had not ſpoken it. Many will object againſt this, that they are far from it, that ſuch thoughts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred into their hearts. But though theſe cogitations come not to their full ſhape or form, yet they are formed in part: And howſoever a man choketh them in their conception, yet there ſtill remaineth ſome bud or other of them in the heart of man. I paſſe by them who commit unlawful actions, thinking that God alſo will

                  <head>Of all the Attributes of God, which is that which we ſee firſt? And which is that which we ſee leaſt?</head>
                  <p>The moſt viſible of all, and that which preſenteth it ſelf firſt to our eyes, is his Power: For howſoever all his Attributes are written in his works, yet ſome are read before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And in the contemplation of this great maſſe of the Univerſe, the firſt thing that cometh into our thought, is the Power and Greatneſſe of the Maker. In the order therefore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100596:12"/>of the leſſons which the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be contained in the works of God, his Power is firſt named; as that which preſenteth it ſelf to be ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other his Attributes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, that which we ſee laſt, and know leaſt, is his Wiſdom. This proceedeth from many cauſes. One of the courſes which the Wiſdom of God taketh, is to conceal his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It worketh oftentimes by means ridiculous and abject: it employeth means quite contrary to what it inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to produce: it permitteth diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion in the world: it giveth the upper hand to them that blaſpheme againſt it: it buildeth up, and throweth down: yea, it hath choſen the folly of the world for one of its principal agents, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. In all this, the Wiſedom of God is ſo much the greater, by how much the leſſe it appeareth: But ſince to us it is very hardly to be perceived in the greater part of theſe actions, it is very
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100596:13"/>hard to know God by his Wiſedom. Naturally men may know him by his Power, becauſe it is ſeen as it were to the eye: but in the Wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Now in effect, this is not to know God, if a man know not his Wiſdom. Hence it cometh, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fall into Atheiſm: For if on the one ſide they ſee a Soveraign Power ſupporting all things, on the other part they ſee a confuſed multitude of events which ſeem not to be governed by a Soveraign Wiſdom. But one of the Attributes of God cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other. It is impoſſible that he which is perfectly Powerful, ſhould not be perfectly Wiſe, though his Wiſdom be not ſo viſible unto us as his Power.</p>

                  <p>In many of theſe paſſages, God ſpeaketh of himſelf in the plural

Who ſhall go for us?</hi> But never doth he uſe this ſtyle, nor yet ever doth he ſpeak in the phraſe of one conſulting, but when he dealeth concerning man, whether it be to give him his being or his well-being, or to guide him, or to preſerve him, or to deſtroy him, or to admoniſh him. What may be the reaſon of this? It is, Not onely becauſe man is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of greater importance then any other that is in the world; rather, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as among all corporeal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, man onely is capable of counſel, onely capable of deliberating. For the holy Spirit would ſhew us, that God hath particular influence upon man, to give him the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting. Moreover, it is to admoniſh man, that he work with counſel, where the buſineſſe requireth it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, it is to aſſure us, that where our counſel is unprofitable, as where we are uncapable of conſulting, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conſulteth for us. Finally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100596:17"/>man oftentimes oppoſeth his Counſel to the Decrees of God, God would ſhew us, that he hath a counſel which prevaileth above ours. For theſe reaſons, he never entereth into counſel, but when the queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth man.</p>

                     </gap>eed any other confutation then what is found written in this primitive Law. I ſpeak not of that which is well known unto all, to wit, That by this Law it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to pervert the order eſtabliſhed from the beginning, to ſeparate what God hath joyned, or joyn together what God hath ſeparated. Hence it cometh to paſſe that the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth Polygamie, becauſe God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated but one wife for <hi>Adam.</hi> Hence alſo proceedeth the ſuperiority of the man over the woman, becauſe he was firſt created of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100596:20"/>
                  <p>By this Law of the Creation, it is forbidden to multiply the number of ſpecies which God hath created at the beginning, or to confound them one with another. Hence it cometh, that the Scripture hath noted with infamy him that firſt invented the procreation of mules, a baſtard kinde which God created not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 36.24.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame Law, it is forbidden to deſtroy a whole ſpecies, of what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever, even of thoſe that are moſt contrary to man. It was in the power of <hi>Noah,</hi> when he had within the Ark Tygers, Vipers, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious creatures, to deſtroy them, to cauſe the whole breed to be loſt; for then there were no more of them in the world: But it was not permitted to him; rather to the contrary, he had order to preſerve them. It is lawful for us to deſtroy the particular of ſuch kindes, but not to proceed to a ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole kinde, though it lay in our power: for this were to tear out a leaf of that great Book which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100596:20"/>containeth the catalogue of the works of the Creation.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame Law, it is impoſſible to reduce any creature to nothing, that is to ſay, to make it ſimply nothing. One matter may be changed into another, as a living body is reſolved into duſt; but it never cometh to be nothing. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not formally ſay that the bread &amp; wine are annihilated in the Euchariſt, but it ſaith that they vaniſh, without withdrawing themſelvs to ſome other place, without entering into the body of Chriſt, without being turned into any other matter. Now according to theſe ſuppoſitions, it is neceſſary that the bread and wine be annihilated and come to nothing: But this pretended annihilation, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the fundamental Law of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It is impoſſible and unlawful. It is impoſſible: for as God alone had the power to create all things out of nothing; ſo he alone can reduce any thing to nothing. It is unlawful: for God himſelf, though he can, yet never

                  <head>Notable examples of the Providence of God, in the Fatalities of Times, of Places, and other circumſtances.</head>

And the two Dreams which he interpreted in the Priſon to the two Officers of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> his houſe, ſerved for a preparatory to his liberty. Finally, he was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Government of all <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the occaſion of two Dreams which he expounded to the King.</p>
                  <p>The meaſures of Times appertain to this Soveraign Providence. See here an example worthy admiration. Before the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites had poſſeſſed the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> the ſpace of 840 yeers: The ten Tribes were carried away a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of this term; but the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> continued the full time. For after the yeer in which they had finiſhed the conqueſt of the land, which was the ſixth yeer of the Government of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to the firſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100596:24"/>yeer of the Captivity, you finde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the number of 840 yeers, which make 12 times 70 yeers; ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venties of yeers, as there was of ſhares when they divided the land, according to the number of the twelve Tribes. And the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> laſted 70 yeers, the twelfth part of the time which they or their fathers had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the land of promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Among the viciſſitudes which we call fatal, this is conſiderable. The Iſraelites going out of the deſert, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in arms into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to make themſelves maſters of it. The war laſted ſix yeers, and in the ſeventh yeer they obtained peaceable poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now having held it about 1500 yeers, comprehending in that time ſome interruptions, even that which happened at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> under <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> finally, the time being come in which they were to be diſpoſſeſſed for ever, the Romanes, under the Empire of <hi>Adrian,</hi> chaſed them fully out by the ſword. This
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100596:24"/>War laſted ſix yeers, according to the Jews own report, who ſince that time never were able to make a body of an Eſtate, nor the body of an Army: So that as by a War of ſix yeers they were eſtabliſhed in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by a War alſo of ſix yeers they were caſt out of it.</p>
                  <p>Among the Provinces of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſo famous in the holy Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, preſented to our ſight an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circle of fatal events. <hi>Galilee</hi> was the firſt that forſook the ſervice of the true God, to receive Paganiſm. After that, it was the firſt that God chaſtiſed, when he ſent the Aſſyrians to deſtroy the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Afterward, it was the firſt to which Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel; as it had been foretold, that <hi>in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali, Galilee of the Gentiles, a light ſhould ſpring up,</hi> Matth. 4. Finally, it was the firſt that the Romanes plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, before the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple: for before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they began the War
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100596:25"/>in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and brought it back under their yoke. Surely, ſo great a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of revolutions in the ſame place, as if it were marked out by the finger of God himſelf, could not proceed from any caſual adventure.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen ſomething alike in our days. In the precedent age, the light of Reformation appeared firſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> from thence it ſpread it ſelf in <hi>France;</hi> and after that, in this Iſland. That age paſſed, the Civil Wars, by which God would chaſtiſe our ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, firſt afflicted the Churches of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> afterward them of <hi>France,</hi> and in the end this ſcourge is come as far as us. The ſame order which God hath kept in the diſpenſation of his graces, hath appeared in the diſtribution of his judgements: For they whom his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy firſt viſited, have been the firſt that have been viſited by his juſtice; and in ſucceſſion others, according to the date of the time of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning.</p>

But there are an infinite number of other ſcourges, general and particular, where oft-times we are conſtrained to chuſe the one, that we may eſcape the other, or at leaſt, we deſire the one rather then the other; it concerneth us that our deſire be lawful. We ſet aſide that which dependeth not at all on our choice, or of which there can be no diſpute but in vain, as, which is worſe to be born deaf, or to be born blinde? Or which is more grievous, Leproſie, or perpetual Infamy? But for example, A man guilty of a capital offence who is permitted to chuſe the kinde and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of his puniſhment; or a dangerous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100596:26"/>labour of a woman, where the life of the mother cannot be ſaved with that of the childe; and many other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences or different afflictions that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter one another in the front, and reduce us to a neceſſity of chuſing one: I conceive that it behoveth to chuſe that in which God is leſſe offended. The choice of <hi>David</hi> was judicious, preferring the Peſtilence before the other two ſcourges, not onely for the reaſon by him expreſſed, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in War and Famine there are committed more ſins, and more enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, then in a Peſtilence.

Neither am I to declare how it is neceſſary that God ſhould ſuffer them: If his Juſtice ſhould extirpate all the wicked, the greater part of the earth would become a deſert; and in ſtead of being peopled with men, would be peopled with ſavage beaſts; and this would redound to the prejudice of them that are good, who from thence would receive a thouſand diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This was the reaſon why God would not deſtroy all at one blowe the inhabitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for fear left the Countrey ſhould fall to be a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſhould be repleniſhed with cruel beaſts, which would have given more trouble to the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>But how can it ſerve to the glory of God, that the number of the wicked ſhould ſurpaſſe the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the good? On the contrary, doth it not ſeem that the glory of God would be more illuſtrious, and of a greater extent, if the good were in greater number then

If it were ſo, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of humane ſociety, and the policy by which it is maintained, would ſeem rather to depend upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, then upon the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. But this is a wonder, that there being far more wicked men then good, nevertheleſſe there is a Providence which hindereth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from doing all the evil that they might do. For whence cometh it, that being in a far greater number, they do not altogether ruine the good?

                  <p>Certainly, if man had remained in his firſt integrity, he had never ſeen the waters of the deluge, nor <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife turned into a ſtatue of Salt, nor any of all thoſe wonders which have ſerved to chaſtiſe man: Neither had he ſeen thoſe miraculous healings, nor the dead rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for neither death nor diſeaſes, which have furniſhed the ſubject of theſe Miracles, had had any place in the ſtate of innocency.</p>
                  <p>The onely kinde of Miracle which God would have ſhewed unto man, if he had ſtil perſiſted in his integrity, had been, according to all probability, to tranſport him at the laſt from earth to heaven, without paſſing thorow death. And this is a notable point, that after the Creation, God wrought no Miracle till the tranſlation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was carried up from earth to heaven. God began his Miracles with that kinde of Miracle which onely ought to have had place, if man had ſtill continued righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100596:33"/>in that perſon; rather, one ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth him in one regard, and another hath to it ſelf alſo a particular mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So that theſe Names ought not to be uſed confuſedly, or without choice; but we are to pronounce that or thoſe among them which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation more to the ſubject of which we treat. If we ſpeak of him who hath ſaved us, the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to him. If the queſtion be of the means by which he hath ſaved us, they are compriſed under the name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If we mention his Commandment, we ſhould ſay, This is the Ordinance of the <hi>Lord.</hi> If we conſider him as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the communion which we have with his Father, there preſenteth it ſelf to us the title of <hi>the Son of God.</hi> There are alſo other ſubjects, to every one of which there may be referred one or more of theſe titles.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid upon this, The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf doth not obſerve theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, uſeth theſe names indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, upon every occaſion. Now I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100596:33"/>confeſſe that in ſo great a multitude of paſſages of the New Teſtament, in which theſe names are repeated, it is impoſſible to ſay why one is rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed then the other. Yet there are ſome reaſons: And then when all theſe names, or the greater part of them are found joyned together, it is to expreſſe the plenitude and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him to whom all theſe titles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain.</p>
                  <p>In the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, he is almoſt everywhere called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other epithet or attribute; becauſe this was the onely name which men gave him, while he converſed in the world: <hi>The man whom they call Jeſus,</hi> ſaid the man that was born blinde, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.11. Sometimes, the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves call him <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth:</hi> but this is when they ſpeak to the Jews, who called him ſo. This language would not be ſo convenient at this day.</p>
                  <p>I paſſe by a queſtion which might be moved, Why the Apoſtle (<hi>Philip.</hi> 2.)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100596:34"/>ſaith that every knee ſhall bow at the name of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And why he doth not ſay at the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor at the name of the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> A reaſon might be given: But for the reſt, We adore not the ſyllables, but him that is repreſented by that name. And the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Name of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> are no leſſe venerable then then the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I am to make an obſervation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ordinary practice of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and of the greater part of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers themſelves. When they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, this is either by way of abbreviation, or elſe by way of cuſtom, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it be to purpoſe to ſay onely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to ſay <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is therefore to be noted, that when the Scriptures ſpeak of his ſufferings and his death, ordinarily they give him none other then the onely name of <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt is dead; Chriſt hath ſuffered; It was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100596:34"/>of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. This may be, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> includeth that of Prieſt, which is the quality in which Chriſt offered himſelf to death. The Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8, 11.) ſaith that we are dead with Chriſt, but living in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. I know that there may be oppoſed ſome excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet in every one of them there is a particular cauſe why one of thoſe Names is rather uſed then another.</p>
                  <p>I will produce one example. There is no man that thinketh he ſpeaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, when he ſaith, <hi>The Supper of Chriſt,</hi> or, <hi>The Supper of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And of a truth, this is not an hereſie, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe it is an impropriety: For if we will ſpeak according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we ſhould ſay, <hi>The Supper of the Lord,</hi> not <hi>The Supper of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is a particularity remarkable, that in the whole deſcription of the Supper, exhibited by the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) and in all the diſcourſe which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of this ſubject and the authour of it, he never giveth other name then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100596:35"/>that of <hi>The Lord. The Supper of the Lord; I have received of the Lord that which alſo I have delivered unto you; The Lord, in the right in the which he was betraid, took bread; You ſhew the Lords death; The cup of the Lord; The body and blood of the Lord; Not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the body of the Lord.</hi> I forbear to ſpeak why in all this deduction the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not once mentioned, and that of the <hi>Lord</hi> is continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. But this example teacheth us that we ought to uſe diſcretion even then when we pronounce the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of him to whom God hath given a name above every name.</p>

                  <head>Whence cometh it that divers diſcourſes uttered by Jeſus Chriſt, ſeem to be without method? And an admirable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which ought to be obſerved.</head>
                  <p>The Hiſtory of the Goſpel reciteth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us divers Sermons &amp; other excellent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100596:36"/>diſcourſes which Jeſus Chriſt made when he converſed among men. Now we may obſerve that in the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe Jeſus Chriſt paſſeth oftentimes from one matter to another which is very far diſtant, and ſeemeth to be quite beſide the ſubject. It ſeemeth to us to ſee pieces brought from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, ill joyned, and without any dependance or tie one with another. Expoſitours labour hard to finde the contexture thereof: but their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Logick which they bring, with all their Analyſes, can never attain it.</p>
                  <p>I paſſe by, that Jeſus Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had the perfection of Divinity.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100596:36"/>ſaw the thoughts and the hearts of thoſe to whom he ſpake. If an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour had this advantage to ſee the thoughts of them that hear him, he would apply himſelf to them, rather then to the ordinary rules of his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, which knoweth not this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. This deſultory ſtyle which we ſee in the diſcourſes of Jeſus Chriſt, hath been often occaſioned by the thoughts of his hearers: According as theſe were formed in them, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to them; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as others thoughts were bred in them, he turned his diſcourſe on that ſide. The ways of this method are tranſcendent, and appertain to none but him who can read in our hearts.</p>

                     <hi>A conjecture of what our Lord wrote, when the Phariſees demanded his judgement touching the puniſhment of the adultereſſe,</hi> Joh. 8.</head>
                  <p>Once onely we finde that he read, and once onely we finde that he wrote.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100596:37"/>That which he read, is recited <hi>Luke</hi> 4. but that which he wrote is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The holy Hiſtory ſaith, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the demand made to him by the Phariſees, ſtooping down, he wrote with his finger upon the ground, two ſeveral times. Some of our moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines think that they were not characters that bare any ſignification, but that they were lines onely or marks drawn without any other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or deſigne, but to divert the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the Phariſees, and to make them know that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any other anſwer. But to take it ſo, this action doth not ſeem ſufficiently grave and ſerious, nor, which is more, ſufficiently worthy of the wiſdom of the Son of God. It is therefore more credible that this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was ſignificative. Now though it be hard to finde what was contained in it, ſince the Hiſtory hath paſſed it over in ſilence, nevertheleſſe many Expoſitours, ancient and modern, have brought their conjectures. Let
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100596:37"/>it be permitted to me to expreſſe mine.</p>
                  <p>The Law (<hi>Numb.</hi> 5.) ordained that a woman ſuſpected of adultery ſhould appear before the Prieſt; who, among divers other ceremonies, took of the duſt which was on the floor of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and mingled it with water in an earthen veſſel: afterward, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put the woman to her oath, he wrote in a note thoſe curſes to which ſhe had ſubmitted; and finally blotted out the writing in the water, which he gave her to drink; having firſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if ſhe were innocent, that drink, which contained the blottings of this writing mingled with the duſt, ſhould not be hurtful to her.</p>
                  <p>Now between this Law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of our Saviour toward the Phariſees, there are found divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances. The buſineſſe is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a woman, an adultereſſe. The Phariſees alleadge the Law of Moſes. Our Lord would that they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves. He writeth in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100596:38"/>duſt on the floor of the Temple, where this action paſſed; as if he ſhould ſay, You your ſelves, are you inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? Could you drink this duſt which beareth the writing of the oath of execration? <hi>Let him among you that is without ſin, caſt the firſt ſtone at her.</hi>

                  <p>God could have raiſed a King, in ſtead of a man clothed with Camels hair, to prepare the way before the Meſſiah: But it would have ſeemed that the foundations of the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is not of this world, had been laid through the ſtrength of the arm of man.

                  <head>Wherefore hath not the Scripture ſet down the day of the Nativity of Jeſus Chriſt?</head>
                  <p>It is not mine aim here to report the divers opinions of them who have ſearched in what ſeaſon of the yeer, in what month and in what day our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was born. Some place his birth, according to the common opinion, at the Winter-Solſtice; others in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal Equinoctial; others in that of the Spring; and all have nothing but conjectures, more ingenuous then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding: For the Hiſtory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by its ſilence, hath left this point in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Now this is it which I will at this preſent conſider, to wit, Why none of the Evangeliſts, nor other of the ſacred Writers, have ſet down a day ſo remarkable; the day, I ſay, of the Nativity of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo much the more ſtrange, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſheweth us the days of divers occurrences which are of leſſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100596:44"/>conſideration. It marketh the month and the Day on which the Deluge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: the Day on which the Ark reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the mountains of <hi>Armenia;</hi> the Day on which the waters were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the earth; the day on which <hi>Noah</hi> began to ſet foot again on the earth: afterward; the Day on which the Iſraelites went up out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> the Day of the deliverance of the Jews, in the Book of <hi>Esther;</hi> the Day on which the Temple was burned by the Babylonians. Wherefore hath it not alſo ſet down the day on which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was born?</p>
                  <p>It might alſo be asked, why the holy Hiſtory mentioneth the time of the yeer and the Day of the death of Chriſt, that of his reſurrection, that of his aſcenſion; and never mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either the Day or the ſeaſon of the yeer of his nativity.</p>
                  <p>To ſay that the Evangeliſts were ignorant of it, or that they had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, or that they were ſilent through inadvertency, or that they neglected
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100596:45"/>it as being not at all conſiderable, this would be to run into a thouſand abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, eaſie to be confuted. There muſt therefore be other reaſons of this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſomething that is myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Now I vaunt not my ſelf to have found out the depth; onely I will touch the ſuperficies.</p>
                  <p>We are therefore to note as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, that the Scripture never ſetteth down the Birth-Day of any Perſon. It ſpeaketh of the Birth of many, it rehearſeth their genealogies, it reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their yeers, and other particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but never ſpeaketh on what Day they were born.</p>
                  <p>We finde that in ſpeaking of ſome, it expreſſeth the Day of their death; as we ſee in the hiſtory of the ten ſons of <hi>Haman, Eſth.</hi> 9. but of whomſoever it ſpeaketh, be they Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, or Kings, or private men, or good, or bad, it never expreſſeth the Day of their Nativity, though ſuch a date may ſeem to import greatly the ſacred Chronologie.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:100596:45"/>
                  <p>Now wherefore the Scripture never nameth the Day of the Birth of the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> no, nor one of them, there is without doubt ſome reaſon, though to us it be obſcure. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that reaſon be, the Birth Day of Jeſus Chriſt is clouded in the ſame ſilence. Wherefore? Surely, to the end that among other things which are common to him with the other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> he might alſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed among them in this point, not to have his Birth-Day expreſſed in the holy Hiſtory. But what doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us that this day is not expreſſed, more then that of other men? As much as it doth concern us that Jeſus Chriſt hath been reckoned among ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even from his Birth. Neither doth it ſerve for an Objection, that he hath been put into their rank more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently, when he was circumciſed, and when he underwent that purification which the Law impoſed upon the firſt-born: for this truth excludeth not others that ſecond it, though they be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100596:46"/>not founded upon expreſſe words of Scripture. It is enough that they are implied. This is out of doubt, that the Scripture never ſaid on what day a man was born. It is alſo out of doubt, that Jeſus Chriſt is compriſed in this univerſal rule. The queſtion is, Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? If I have not found the true reaſon, I have at the leaſt pointed out a principle upon which it may be ſearched.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this, that in ſtead of the Birth Day of Jeſus Chriſt, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures expreſſe that of his death. That is, among divers other reaſons becauſe he died on the ſame day on which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was created, to wit, the ſixth day of the week. The creation of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the death of the ſecond, met in the ſame day. The impurity of our birth, which we have from the firſt, had not been purged but by the death of the ſecond.</p>

                  <p>There have been none but theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men, upon whom this power hath been conferred. The other Miracles which are recited in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or which have gone before the coming of the Son of God, have been wrought without the intervention of men.</p>
                  <p>There may be, to ſpeak this by the way, ſome alluſion or reference of the ſeven Angels of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sun and upon all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to theſe ſeven men which have

                  <p>That which I have here to ſay, is this; That the New Teſtament hath been furniſhed with a greater number of perſons endued with the power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeles, then the Old was; yea, with a very far greater number. At one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time, the Lord ordained ſeventy men, with power to heal the ſick, to cleanſe the lepers, to raiſe the dead, to caſt out devils, to tread upon ſerpents and ſcorpions, and upon all the force of the enemy: And this, without rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning the twelve principal diſciples, who were alſo provided of the ſame gift: and thoſe which afterward had it, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and others. I account this point among the advantages of the New Teſtament, that in it the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power of God hath raiſed ſo great a number of inſtruments, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them which it employed for the Old Teſtament.</p>

               <div type="section">

                  <head>Wherefore till the coming of the Son of God, there have paſſed many ages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that any perſon hath had the gift of Miracles.</head>
                  <p>The laſt of all thoſe which wrought Miracles before the coming of our Lord, was <hi>Eliſha.</hi> Now from <hi>Eliſha</hi> till that time when the Son of God began to manifeſt his glory by Miracles, there paſſed welnigh eight hundred yeers. In ſo long an interval of yeers, there was not found a perſon that had the gift of Miracles, although many had that of Prophecie.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, the wiſdom of God would that this great length of time ſhould ſerve to make them deſire that which had not been ſeen after ſo many ages, to wit, Miracles wrought by the hand of man; as afterward, thoſe that were ſpectatours glorified God, that had done this honour unto men in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them this power, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.8. That it ſhould diſpoſe their ſpirits to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100596:49"/>of the Meſſiah, who was to come with miraculous works. That it ſhould ſerve to make them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to weigh the importance of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, after ſo long a ſurceaſe of the gift of Miracles. And laſtly, that which is the principal, that it ſhould ſerve to diſtinguiſh him from other men.</p>
                  <p>To ſee how, behold this that ought to be conſidered. We ſay, and it is true, that the Miracles of our Lord have demonſtrated that he is the Chriſt. This proof ſeemeth not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: for <hi>Elijah, Joſhua, Moſes,</hi> and the others which we have mentioned, wrought Miracles alſo, and yet no man ever thought that any of them was the Chriſt. But this was becauſe none of them came at the time which had been ſet down for the coming of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, but all preceded it very far. The Divine Providence did purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe a long diſtance of ages between them and the time which was deſtined for the coming of Chriſt, to the end to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100596:50"/>ſhew that none of them could be the Chriſt. If then when the coming of Chriſt approached, ſome other had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with the gift of Miracles, he might have been taken for the Meſſiah himſelf, conſidering the concurrence of time: but this inconvenience hath been prevented. The following que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is referred alſo to this.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Why none of them from whom Chriſt is deſcended according to the fleſh, hath had the gift of Miracles.</head>
                  <p>This is remarkable, that of ſo many anceſtours of whom Chriſt is iſſued, there is not one that hath wrought a Miracle: Neither <hi>Enoch,</hi> nor <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>David,</hi> nor ſo great a number of other famous men, have been honored with this gift. And it is eſpecially to be conſidered, that none of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> wrought Miracles, till our Lord came.</p>
                  <p>This Tribe had been deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all others, to be that of which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100596:50"/>Chriſt ought to be born. It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant then that none of this race ſhould work any Miracle before our Lord, to the end that none other might be taken for the Meſſiah. Of all thoſe which have wrought Miracles, there was not one of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Not <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were of the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> Not <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who was of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Not <hi>Elijah</hi> nor the others, the Tribe of whom is either different or uncertain. Our Lord is the firſt of the lineage of <hi>Judah,</hi> that wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. And before him, God would never grant that power to any perſon of that Tribe.</p>

                  <head>Why John the Baptiſt had not the gift of Miracles.</head>
                  <p>The birth of ſo great a man, who was more then a Prophet, was truely preceded by Miracles, but himſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought any Miracle. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in part, for the ſame cauſe which I have already ſpoken, to the end that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100596:51"/>it might not be thought that he was the Chriſt, whereas he was none other then his forerunner. And indeed, already eyes were caſt upon him as if he had been the Meſſiah. But there is alſo another reaſon which ought here to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that wrought Miracles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, was the ſame man that gave the Law, to wit, <hi>Moſes.</hi> The firſt alſo that wrought Miracles in the New Teſtament, was the ſame that brought the Goſpel, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt. This prerogative appertained to him, to be the firſt which ſhould ſeal the New Teſtament by Miracles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had been the firſt that ſealed the Old. This could not be agreeable to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes he hath brought forth one great Miracle, to be the forerunner of a greater Miracle. Having healed the ſervant of the Centurion, who was neer unto death, on the morrow he raiſed him who was perfectly dead, to wit, the young man of <hi>Naim, Luke</hi> 7. Having healed her who had been ſick twelve yeers, the ſame day he raiſed her that had been dead, being of the age of twelve yeers, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>It behoveth here to note the divers ages of ſickneſſes and infirmities of thoſe which he healed. Some had been afflicted ſince twelve yeers; as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man already ſpoken of. Others, ſince eighteen yeers; as the woman bowed together, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.11.

                  <p>We are not of the opinion that this came to paſſe caſually, or for want of occaſion, or without cauſe worthy to be conſidered, that our Lord was the alone man that hath exerciſed the power of Miracles within the houſe of his Father: This is one of the marks of his preeminence, and of the juriſdiction which he had in that place. Many men have wrought Miracles in divers parts, but none of them wrought them within the compaſſe of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was promiſed (<hi>Malach.</hi> 3.) that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100596:53"/>the Lord, which is the Meſſiah, ſhould come into his Temple. Now Jeſus Chriſt willing to ſhew that it was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that was to come, cauſed himſelf to be taken notice of within the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it ſelf, by the Miracles which there he produced; there, I ſay, where none other had that power.</p>
                  <p>It may be obſerved here, that there have been two perſons that have been ſtruck with miraculous plagues in the Temple; a King, and a Prieſt; to wit, <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> the father of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. The one became le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, and the other dumb; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. But never any ſick or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent were miraculouſly healed in the Temple, till the comming of the Son of God, who there healed the blinde and the lame, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.14.</p>

                  <p>When others wanted drink, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed water into wine: But when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was thirſty, he deſired water of the Samaritan woman. When others were hungry, he multiplied the loaves, and ſatisfied thouſands of men: But when himſelf was preſſed with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and had addreſſed himſelf to the fig tree which had no fruit, he cauſed none to be brought forth, though he could have done it forthwith. So he endured the wearineſſe of the way, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6.) although he might have cauſed himſelf to have been carried by Angels, or lifted up by the Spirit, as <hi>Philip</hi> afterward was, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.39, 40.

                  <p>As he came for others, ſo all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have been for others. And this

                  <p>SOmetimes the Scripture expreſſeth the name of a man who ſeemeth to be of little importance, and ſometimes it ſuppreſſeth the name of another which ſhould be more conſiderable. It tells us the name of the robber whom the Jews preferred before Jeſus Chriſt, when <hi>Pilate</hi> gave them the choice to releaſe to them one of the two: Yet it nameth not the thief which was converted, although that it ſhould ſeem that his name ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be mentioned then that of the other. Now ſetting aſide the reaſons of this ſilence, we will retain this, that when the Scripture expreſſeth the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100596:56"/>name of a wicked man, this is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways onely to ſet down the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Hiſtory, but often for other cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Among all the wicked men which are compriſed in the Hiſtory of the Paſſion, there are ſeven marked by their names: <hi>Judas, Annas</hi> and <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, Malchus, Herod, Barabbas,</hi> and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate.</hi> Now it ſeemeth that the Scripture, which reciteth how all ſorts of men contributed to the death of Chriſt, would alſo name one of every condition: One of the houſhold of Chriſt; One High Prieſt, and another inferiour; One ſervant; One King; One Judge; yea, one thief. This doth not exclude the particular reaſons for which every one of theſe men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid hath his name in this Hiſtory. It importeth that <hi>Malchus,</hi> who was none other then a ſervant, was named as well as <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> and <hi>Barabbas,</hi> as well as <hi>Pilate,</hi> though the one be more conſiderable then the other.</p>

                  <p>Now although they are ſeparated the one from the other, by divers ſo long diſtances in regard of yeers, yet they all meet together in the ſame day. The Hiſtory teacheth us that the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100596:57"/>went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> within that proper day and the ſame night in which came to be expired the four hundred and thirty yeers which had paſt after the calling of <hi>Abraham.</hi> That calling then came to paſſe on the ſame day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.

                  <head>An advertiſement touching the Name of Altar improperly aſcribed to the Croſſe.</head>
                  <p>I repeat now what I have ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Treatiſe. There is nothing more ordinary in this ſubject, then to hear named <hi>The Alter of the Croſſe;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext that Jeſus Chriſt was offered on the Croſſe. But it followeth not that the Croſſe had the place or quality of an Altar in this Oblation. Neither doth the Scripture ever call it ſo, although it ſpeaketh ſo often of the Croſſe and of the Sacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Let it not diſpleaſe ſo many learned men who have authorized this vulgar phraſe, That Chriſt was offered on the <hi>Altar of the Croſſe.</hi> The Croſſe was not the Altar of this incomparable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The name of <hi>Altar</hi> is of greater importance then many men conſider. This is an irrefragable Maxime, That the Altar is greater then the Offering
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100596:58"/>in as much as it is the Altar which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the Offering, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.19. Whence would follow, that which none ſhould dare to think, that the Croſſe ſhould be more excellent then the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, yea, that it had ſanctified it.</p>
                  <p>All that can be ſaid, when the name of <hi>Altar</hi> is given to the Croſſe, is this, that it is not underſtood ſo in effect, but onely by way of ſimilitude or alluſion. But ſuch a ſimilitude transferreth to the Croſſe a title which appertaineth to none but Chriſt; for on the Croſſe himſelf was the Altar, the Sacrifice, and the Prieſt altogether. Under the Law, theſe were different things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of theſe figures alone could not repreſent Chriſt in all theſe three qualities; but in him they are found united, and no creature hath had part in this honour. Why then ſhould we communicate it to the wood of the Croſſe? Either this phraſe hath help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward the adoration of the Croſſe; or it hath proceeded from that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100596:59"/>or howſoever it be, it hath been unwiſely introduced, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed to the conſequences which it draweth after it.</p>

                  <head>Why the Scripture ſpeaketh of what matter the Croſſe was made, yet expreſſeth not the form of it.</head>
                  <p>It concerneth us to know that it was of wood. This particularity ſhould ſeem little conſiderable, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had not opened the myſtery, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe, inſomuch as he was hanged on the tree; becauſe this kinde of death was curſed by the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. But for the ſtructure of it, of how many pieces it was compoſed, how they were placed, and in ſum, what fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure it had, this is that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture paſſeth under ſilence, as not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.

                  <p>We ſhall obſerve from hence, that ſuppoſing we had the true figure of the Croſſe, and that it were an object of adoration, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, this honour would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to any but Croſſes of wood; for Jeſus Chriſt was not crucified on a Croſſe of ſtone, or ſilver.

                  <p>The Law forbade the High Prieſt to touch a dead corps, yea to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any houſe in which there was one deceaſed, yea to ſhew any ſigne of grief, were it for his own father or mother, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.10, 11.

                  <p>But on the contrary, Jeſus Chriſt entered into the houſe where lay the dead body of the daughter of <hi>Jairus:</hi> Himſelf took her by the hand: He

It is a matter of aſtoniſhment that theſe great men have been ſo exceeding fearful of their departure out of this world. Here I paſſe by the particular cauſes from whence proceeded this weakneſſe. But in general, before that Jeſus Chriſt died, death was more dreadful then it hath been ſince; for as yet death was not ſwallowed up in Victory; and the faithful of the Old Teſtament had not the example of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt dead, as we have. The fear of death therefore was more juſt in them, then it can be in us: From
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100596:62"/>whence it followeth, that it is not ſtill permitted to us to ſpeak as they did when we are menaced with death. It would be very hard to approve that a Chriſtian ſhould complain of this, that he ſhould no more behold God in the land of the living, and that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the converſation of this world; or to alleadge, that he might not die, that the dead praiſe not God.

                  <head>An obſervation upon the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 10.6, 7.</hi> forbidding to ask who ſhall aſcend into heaven, or who ſhall deſcend into the abyſſe?</head>
                  <p>AMong ſo many men ſignalized by extraordinary events, there are two remarkable; one of which aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heaven, and deſcended; the other deſcended into the deep, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcended. The firſt is <hi>Elijah,</hi> who was carried up into heaven, and afterward came back to the earth, to accompany the Son of God in his Transfiguration. The other is <hi>Jonah,</hi> who went into the bottom of the gulfs, and returned li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. But the one and the other were but a ſhadow of Chriſt, to whom all theſe paſſages and returns agree more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100596:63"/>particularly: For not onely he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the Abyſſe and returned, but he is alſo aſcended into heaven yet once more to come down.</p>
                  <p>Now I go not about to examine in what ſenſe he ſaid, even before his Aſcenſion, that already he had aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaven, and already had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. But concerning his deſcent into the deep, the Apoſtle explaineth it openly, when he oppoſeth thoſe two one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>To deſcend into the deep,</hi> and <hi>To be brought back from the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d.</hi> For from thence followeth, that to be brought back from the dead, is to reaſcend from the Abyſſe. And this alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth, that to deſcend into the Abyſſe, is none other thing then to be reduced to the eſtate of the dead. As for the name of the Abyſſe, it is known that Jeſus Chriſt calleth his Sepulchre the heart of the earth, comparing it to the place where <hi>Jonah</hi> had been in the Abyſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40. From hence it cometh, that many underſtand by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100596:64"/>the deſcent of Chriſt into hell, that after his burial he was yet farther hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſo far as to ſojourn in the eſtate of the dead, that is to ſay, within his Sepulcher, from whence he was raiſed by his Reſurrection.</p>

                     <hi>Why Chriſt being on the Croſſe, pronounced the firſt words of the</hi> 22 Pſalm.</head>
                  <p>Theſe words expreſſe the complaint which he made of being forſaken of God. And many Orthodox men take that extreme humiliation of Chriſt for his deſcent into hell. Now why he did uſe the words of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given. There is not a paſſage in all the Old Teſtament which better repreſenteth the eſtate of Chriſt upon the Croſſe. There is ſeen the parting of his garments, the caſting of lots for his coat, his hands and feet pierced, his enemies wagging the head, and vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their mockeries. He therefore u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as having been dictated for him.</p>

                  <p>But to this reaſon, which is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every one, I will adde another, which I ground upon an hypotheſis maintained by ſome interpreters. The firſt action, ſay they, that the Prieſts and the Levites daily did in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, into which they entered at break of day, was to ſing this two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>Pſalm;</hi> the which, upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beareth for the title, <hi>A Pſalm of the dawning of the day,</hi> and beginneth, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> I obſerve from hence, that the firſt words with which the Prieſts began the firſt hour and the firſt act of their Functions, are the ſame which Chriſt uttered in the laſt hour and the laſt act of the Redemption: For having been already three hours upon the Croſſe, upon the point of rendering up his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the hands of his Father, and of declaring that all was finiſhed, he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> He ended where the Prieſts began, to ſhew that all the ancient Prieſthood, and all the ſervice of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100596:65"/>Temple, from their beginning, then expired and finiſhed in him, who is the end and cloſure of the Law.</p>

                  <head>Why the Son of God deſerred ſo long time to come and expiate the ſins of the world.</head>
                  <p>THis queſtion, which the ignorant will blame of raſhneſſe, is ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by the Scripture it ſelf, which hath ſet down the ſolution of it. It is not enough to ſay, according to the faſhion of the ignorant, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came not ſooner, becauſe God would not have it ſo. We are to know why he would it not, ſince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſhewed us the cauſes, in the which are ſeen the rays of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wiſdom.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:100596:65"/>
                  <p>About four thouſand yeers paſſed after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> before the Son of God came: Sin multiplied with the multiplication of mankinde: Death deſtroyed one generation after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: All ages groaned for the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer; but he appeared not till after ſo long a time.</p>
                  <p>Now ſetting aſide the marvellous Oeconomy by which God meaſured and divided the times which preceded the coming of Chriſt, in which is ſeen an infinity of ſteps and proportions, as ſo many ſtars which marched before the Sun; we will onely ſay, That it was important for the glory of God, and to render ſo much the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the benefit of Redemption, that ſin and death ſhould reign a long time, and devour a long rank of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before the Saviour ſhould ſhew himſelf: For that long durance of ſin and death, extending it ſelf thorow ſo many ages, and infolding all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of people born the one after the other, hath cauſed to be ſeen how
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100596:66"/>great was the miſery of mankinde, and the neceſſity of the remedy; and how great is the vertue of Chriſt who hath healed an evil ſo univerſal, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                  <p>That for theſe ends, and to ſhew the abundance of Grace, God permitted that ſin ſhould abound; and that it might abound, the Law intervened, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. It behoved therefore firſt that there ſhould paſſe a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law ſhould begin her raign, and a long time before ſhe ſhould yeeld place unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> loſt thoſe that came after him; but the death of Chriſt hath ſaved both them that went before and came after it. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> hath cauſed to die thoſe which were born many ages after him; ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them which were dead many ages before him. And this hath been one of the cauſes of the retarding of his coming, to wit, that he would ſhew his power working backward to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ages.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:100596:66"/>
                  <p>And finally, That it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, before Chriſt died, to make it known to the world that the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſins could not be wrought any other way. To this effect, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed firſt the blood of beaſts in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; afterward, the blood of man in Circumciſion; afterward, an infinite number of waſhings, with all the works of the Law; as if he would that men ſhould aſſay all the means which could be imagined for the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſins. But this was to the end that they ſhould acknowledge their impotency, and ſhould caſt their eyes upon the future Sacrifice of Chriſt. Now it was requiſite that a good part of the age of the world ſhould paſſe in the ſtudie of theſe rudiments, before God ſhould ſend his Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>An admirable concurrence of the time of Redemption with the times of the moſt famous Ceremonies of the Law. An obſervation upon this ſubject.</head>
                  <p>It concerneth us that we know the Yeer, the Seaſon, the Days, yea the Hours, in the which Chriſt perfected the work of the Redemption. The Law hath marked certain Times as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table among all others. Among Yeers, that of Jubilee, which returned from fifty to fifty yeers, in the which ſervants were ſet at liberty, and lands alienated returned to their firſt owners. Among the annual Feaſts, that of the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which was the firſt and principal of all the ſolemnities of the yeer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Days, the Sabbath, of which the preeminencies are ſufficiently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. Among the Hours of the day, that between the two veſpers, which we reckon the third after noon; in which every day was offered the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Sacrifice, which was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100596:67"/>of all daily Ceremonies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.39. and in which alſo was ſlain the Paſchal Lamb, when his yeer-day was come, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6.</p>
                  <p>Now the Redemption met in all theſe times; in the Yeer of Jubilee, in the Paſſeover, in the Hour of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Sacrifice, and in the Sabbath. In the Yeer of Jubilee, according to the moſt exact Chronologie, which rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning every fiftieth yeer after the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Land of promiſe to the yeer in which Chriſt died, findeth that he ſuffered in the yeer of Jubilee: in the Paſſeover, as it is evident by the Hiſtory of the Paſſion: in the Hour of the Evening Sacrifice, which the Jews called the ninth hour, in the which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt gave up the Ghoſt: And finally, in the Sabbath, our Saviour all that day reſting in the Sepulchre. I know that many, long time agone, have conſidered all theſe particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but in parcels, every one ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That which I here obſerve, is the general concurrence of all the times
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100596:68"/>the moſt famous in the Law, with the time of the Redemption, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and determined all.</p>
                  <p>To all this I will adde this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The yeer of Jubilee began the tenth day after the Equinoctial of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptember, Levit.</hi> 15.9. and Jeſus Chriſt died a few days after the Equinoctial of the Spring following: Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that he died in the midſt of the yeer of Jubilee, between the ſix firſt months and the ſix laſt: But the laſt ſix months which his death anticipated, have been disjoyned from the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as appertaining no more to the yeer of Jubilee, which hath been cut aſunder in the middle, that it might be rendered wholly dead.</p>

                     <hi>A myſterious reaſon of the name which the Apoſtle giveth to the Sacrifice of Chriſt, calling it</hi> A Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2.</head>
                  <p>Many read theſe terms of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, without knowing the importance,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100596:68"/>nor ſeeing at what they aim. The common Expoſitours will be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tell us, that the Sacrifice of Chriſt is of a good ſmell, that is to ſay, pleaſing to God. We know that this is true: but to know it well, we ought to learn from whence the Apoſtle fetched this phraſe, and what it is at which he looketh back.</p>
                  <p>It behoveth therefore to obſerve that there were two kindes of Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the Law. One ſort was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a perfume of Incenſe which was burned with them; and for this cauſe they are called <hi>Offerings of a ſweet ſavour,</hi> Levit. 2.2.9. The others, howſoever approved by the Law, bare not the name of <hi>Oblations of a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> becauſe they were without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.12. And particularly it is to be noted, that it was forbidden to burn any perfume upon the Oblations which were preſented for ſins, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.11. in which the Law-giver gave to underſtand, that the memory of ſin, yea the Sacrifices which mentioned
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100596:69"/>them, were not of a ſweet ſavour, <hi>Numb</hi> 5.15.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, we are to conſider why the Law declared that that which was offered for ſins, could not be of a ſweet ſavour, ſeeing that Chriſt was offered for ſins, and yet his Oblation was of a ſweet ſavour to God his Father. The reaſon is, that the Legal Oblations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved not at all the infection of the ſin which they repreſented, rather themſelves remained burdened with it: But Chriſt bearing our ſins upon him, vanquiſhed and carried away this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. This point furniſheth us with an invincible argument againſt the Jews. By the own ſentence of the Law, all the Expiatory Offerings which it preſcribed, failed of a ſweet favour, and could not content the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God. From whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (otherwiſe we are for ever miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) that there is another kinde of Offering, another Sacrifice of Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, quite other then thoſe of the Law, which aboliſheth the ſtench of our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100596:69"/>crimes. And this quality cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain but to the body of Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53 5, 6.</p>

                  <head>Why Chriſt roſe not again the day after his death; but ſuffered the whole Sabbath day to paſſe over, before he returned to life.</head>
                  <p>I paſſe by the ordinary reaſons which are brought concerning this, and will onely obſerve a Maxime which I finde in this matter, to wit, <hi>That never any dead man was raiſed again on the Sabbath day.</hi> The Son of God hath healed

I ſhall verifie this, when I ſhall come to expound the fourth Commandment of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. For the preſent queſtion, we may ſay that Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Head of the Reſurrection, would ſhew the communion which is between him and others that are raiſed, in whom we have a preludium of the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And foraſmuch as none of them recovered life on the Sabbath day, he alſo, not to ſeem to disjoyn himſelf from them, would not that his Reſurrection ſhould fall on that day.

The healing alſo of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a type. He was held in the rank of the dead, and his bed was to him a grave.

                  <p>But that which I obſerve concerning this laſt, and which I adde to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of thoſe which have gone before me, is another correſpondence which is found between the wonders that befell in this ſubject; the one in the ſickneſſe of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the other in the death of Chriſt. In both theſe there was a Miracle in the Sun: For the Eclipſe of this Luminary, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100596:73"/>happened at the death of Chriſt, was ſupernatural, as well as the going back in the ſickneſſe of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> So that this type meeteth with Chriſt dead and raiſed from the dead by a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. But the ſhadow which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ten degrees backward, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew the return of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the courſe of his life, was not ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as the return of Chriſt from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead, verified by ten Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, by which, as by ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, he ſhewed himſelf living again upon the earth, before he aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven.</p>

                  <head>Why none ever was raiſed again the third day after his death, but onely Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>Of all thoſe whom God hath cauſed to return into the world after they were dead, there is not one whom the Scripture ſaith to have been raiſed on the Third Day. If there had been any one, this circumſtance had not been omitted in Hiſtory. All have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100596:74"/>been raiſed either before or after the Third Day after their deceaſe, but none on that day. The ſon of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sarephta,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Eutychus,</hi> were certainly raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the very day of their death. The ſon of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> he of <hi>Naim, Tabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> and the man which was raiſed from death in the Sepulchre of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> moſt probably had not yet reached to their Third Day among the dead, when they returned to life: As on the contrary, many others have been raiſed after their third day, to wit, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the Saints that roſe from the duſt, when Chriſt roſe again.</p>
                  <p>This circumſtance of the Third Day for the Reſurrection, hath been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to Chriſt, and marked out for him in the Calender of the Prophets, to the end that among other ſignes which diſtinguiſh him from all others that were raiſed, he might be known alſo by this, as particular to him, to wit, that his Reſurrection befell on the Third Day, according to the Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, our Lord let paſſe the Third Day, before he raiſed him, and ſtayed till the Fourth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.39. Among divers reaſons of this delay, I reckon this. The Son of God would not raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> the ſame day of his deceaſe, nor before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Sepulchre, becauſe he had already raiſed two dead which had not as yet been put into the earth, to wit, the young man of <hi>Naim,</hi> and the daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> which was deceaſed but a few hours before. Now his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to extend his power yet farther, to wit, as far as within the grave; as he did, when from thence he fetched <hi>Lazarus.</hi> But this dead man had not his Reſurrection on the Third Day, our Lord having deferred if till the Fourth, and hindering the concurrence of it with his own, in regard of this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                  <p>The two firſt were preparatories to the wonders of the third.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it may be asked, Why being raiſed from the dead, they ſtayed no longer time in the world, that there might have been ſome time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them? And in ſum, Why none of the Patriarchs or of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have been called back from the dead, to ſojourn a while among men, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> or <hi>Eutychus?</hi> But without ſpeaking of the Fathers of the Old Teſtament, I will yet make this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Why did not our Lord raiſe <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who had been his forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and his contemporary in the days of his fleſh? Was it not to the purpoſe that that excellent Prophet, ſo great a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100596:77"/>light of the Church, and who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death for the Truth, ſhould be returned unto life, as well as the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Jairus,</hi> or the young man of <hi>Naim?</hi>

                  <p>It is eaſie to conjecture why this was not done. If <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or any one of the Prophets, or any one of them who wrought Miracles in their life time, had returned to the world there to make their abode, there had never wanted thoſe who would have honoured them exceſſively.

This is one of the cauſes for which God li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked better to raiſe an ordinary man, who had touched the bones of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> then to raiſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> himſelf: For ſuch a Prophet, that had been ſo famous in Miracles, had been adored by men, if he had returned from the grave to be among them.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo another particular
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100596:78"/>reaſon concerning <hi>John</hi> the Paptiſt. It is known how high his reputation had been. After his death, that was aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him which was not: For when the Son of God cauſed himſelf to be known by his miraculous actions, divers notwithſtanding took him for <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, whom they imagined to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead, and to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of thoſe marvels that then were wrought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.2. and 16.13, 14. This errour had paſſed further, if that Prophet had in effect been raiſed: But it was requiſite that that light ſhould give place to a greater Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince he came not but onely to bring men unto Chriſt. To conclude, Chriſt is the onely Prophet that made any ſtay after his death, to the end that he might be adored by them. All the reſt that returned from the dead, either have been perſons that had nothing extraordinary in their life, or have not ſtayed alive ſome few moments of time upon the earth; but Chriſt ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fourty days, and converſed with

                  <p>We need not demand whether we would be curious to ſee a man that had returned from the dead, or whether we would deſire to ſpeak with him. How many queſtions ſhould we aſk him?

When <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was raiſed, great troops of the Jews ran to ſee him: Without doubt, they had as much curioſity as we have, to aſk and to hear him diſcourſe. And ſurely they whom God reſtored to life, recovered alſo their ſpeech; yet the Scripture reporteth not any thing which hath been ſpoken by them: And
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100596:79"/>even when <hi>Eutychus</hi> was raiſed, (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.9.) which happened in the preſence of many ſpectatours, he put himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the aſſembly, to hear Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> nor did they forſake the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, to aſk or hearken to one that was returned from the dead. We read indeed that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> being returned to the world, ſpake with the Son of God in his Transfiguration; and the ſubject, of their diſcourſe was of the deceaſe which the Redeemer was to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh in <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 9. But for the reſt, all the dead which have been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, keep ſilence in the Hiſtory; for it reciteth not any one word which they uttered, although it obſerveth other particularities which ſeem leſſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. And this is true of all thoſe whoſe reſurrection it hath deſcribed, there being not one of them who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto us ſpeaking.

We finde therefore that this is an honour reſerved to Chriſt, to be the onely man, among them that were raiſed from the dead, whoſe words ſhould be regiſtred; the onely one which ſpeaketh in the Scripture; the onely one from among the dead, whom we can hear. Wherefore the holy Hiſtory expreſſeth very amply the words which the Son of God uttered after his Reſurrection, to divers perſons, &amp; upon divers ſubjects: but for the reſt which returned from the dead, it mentioneth not ſo much as one word of all that they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

                  <p>All the Judgements which God hath ſhewed or yet doth ſhew upon any parts of mankinde, are but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. There are four which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned or do concern all the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The three firſt have already
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100596:84"/>appeared, and the fourth is at the door.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Judgement is that which God pronounced againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife, who repreſented all their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The ſecond is that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the inhabitants of the world, except eight, to periſh by the waters of the Deluge. The third is that which divided the ſociety of men, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Tongues, in <hi>Babel.</hi> The fourth is that of the laſt Day.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Judgement deprived men of immortality, and declared them ſubject to death, which, by power of it, is come upon them ſucceſſively. The ſecond cauſed all mankinde to die at one time, reſerving a very ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons. The third brake off the communion which was among men, bereaving them of their univerſal language, and hindering them from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding one another.</p>
                  <p>Now there are divers reſemblances and differences between theſe three firſt Judgements which are paſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100596:84"/>and the fourth, which is yet to come. But we have onely to conſider, that in the firſt three, God hath judged the living; but at the laſt he ſhall judge both the living and the dead. Upon this ſubject, I am to propound the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Obſervation.</p>

                  <p>The life of man hath two different iſſues: Some going out of the world by a violent death, others by a natural. But thoſe which ſhall be found alive when our Lord ſhall come to the laſt Judgement, ſhall paſſe neither by the one nor the other of theſe two ways, but by a third, which ſhall be a ſudden tranſmutation of their bodies, by the which they ſhall become incorruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. So then there are three ſeveral kindes of iſſues ordained to men, to diſlodge out of this world, ſome by one, ſome by another; to wit,

                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe three ways, the two firſt have been open to this day, and are the ordinary paſſage of mortals. The third is reſerved for the laſt inhabitants of the world.</p>
                  <p>All theſe three ſeveral iſſues have been viſibly marked out in the three firſt men that have parted out of this life: for the firſt that diſlodged, was <hi>Abel;</hi> the ſecond was <hi>Adam;</hi> the third was <hi>Enoch.</hi>

                     <item>The firſt went out of the world by a violent death,</item>
                     <item>The ſecond, by a natural death.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe three went in this order, and the one followed the other immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, among them whoſe departure is mentioned in the Scripture. But they went by different ways, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100596:85"/>all thoſe by which men were to paſſe after them: For all thoſe which ſhall go out of the world after theſe three firſt, or who ſhall go out hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which ſoever of theſe three ways, go but in the footſteps of ſome one of theſe three forerunners, who are (in this regard) an abridgement of all mankinde, divided as in three bands. And particularly, as thoſe who ought to paſſe by that above-named change, to be tranſlated from this life without ſeeing death, ſhall be the laſt that diſlodge; ſo <hi>Enoch,</hi> who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them, parted from this world the laſt of the three; being preceded by <hi>Abel,</hi> who died a violent death; and by <hi>Adam,</hi> who departed by a natural death. We are here to admire the diſpenſation of this great God, and the Wiſdom of his Spirit which dictated the Scriptures. Theſe three men whom God firſt withdrew from the world, the diverſity which is ſeen in their going out, and the order held in it, were a ſample or epitome of that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100596:86"/>great piece which he would unfold all along the ages, and which was to be extended as far as the laſt men that ſhall be found living upon the earth.</p>

                  <head>Why God, who hath foretold and ſet down the meaſures of certain particular times, hath not revealed how long the world ſhould endure, or when the day of Judgement ſhould be.</head>
                  <p>God at other times foretold, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny veers ſpace it ſhould be before the Deluge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. How many yeers the ſlavery of the Hebrews ſhould endure, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. How many yeers there ſhould be of plenty and famine, in the days of <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 41.29.30. How many yeers the Jews ſhould remain in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 25.12. and 29.10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. How many yeers ſhould paſſe to the death of Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. We know that ſome of theſe predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been given four hundred, yea four hundred and ninety yeers before their time expired. Now there might
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100596:86"/>be all the way computed, from day to day, how many yeers yet remained to the end of the time limited by thoſe oracles. Yea, God hath not onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an account of yeers, but ſometimes hath punctually ſet down the very day on which a deliverance or other event ſhould come to paſſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11, 12.</p>
                  <p>But neither the Day of the laſt Judgement, nor the Yeer, nor yet the Age which is to make an end of all the reſt, was ever ſet down in any Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, whatſoever the curious can ſay againſt it. Now among the cauſes of this ſilence, we are to conſider this. When God hath foretold that ſuch or ſuch a notable event, where the time could not be foreſeen by any humane wiſdom, ſhould come to paſſe in ſuch a Yeer or on ſuch a Day, the principal ſcope of theſe predictions hath been to confirm the faith of them which ſhould ſee them accompliſhed, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 13.19.) For they that lived until that time, and ſaw the Prophecie effected preciſely at the day named, even againſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100596:87"/>had ſo much the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe in God for the time to come, in ſo manifeſt an experience of his infallible truth: and the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was a means to convert unbelievers. But at the laſt Day it will not be the work to make proviſion any more for faith in regard of things to come; not will there be any more place for the converſion of miſcreants. So that a revelation of that Day could not ſerve for thoſe ends and uſes for the which God had revealed divers other Days remarkable. The Wiſdom of God doth not give us ſuperfluous predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is neceſſary to know that there ſhall be a laſt Day, but not to know preciſely when it ſhall be.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That of all the ſpecies which were encloſed in the maſſe of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the beginning of the world: for, to cauſe them to bring forth, <hi>the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> Gen. 1.2.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That of the body of Chriſt, which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100596:88"/>alone among all men was conceived by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That of the new man: For, to become ſuch, it behoveth to be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5, 6.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Why the Scripture repreſenteth the holy Ghoſt, and his effects, under the names of <hi>Water,</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> of <hi>Anointing with Oil,</hi> and of <hi>Sprinkling of Blood.</hi> The true interpretation of theſe terms, contained in divers paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</head>
                  <p>The Scripture ſpeaketh of Water and the Spirit, by which we are to be born again: Of the holy Ghoſt and of Fire, with which we are to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized: Of the Unction which we have from the holy One, which is an effect of the ſame Spirit: Of the Sprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is wrought alſo by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. So that the names of <hi>Water,</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> of <hi>Anointing with Oil,</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:100596:88"/>and of <hi>Sprinkling of Blood,</hi> are uſed to denote either the holy Ghoſt, or thoſe acts which he worketh in us. Now it is very eaſie for one of the vulgar to ſpeak to this, and to ſay they are ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes. Many Commentatours and ordinary Preachers content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to alleadge to us ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances between Water and the holy Ghoſt; and likewiſe ſome conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and analogies between the Fire, which purifieth and conſumeth, and the holy Ghoſt, which produceth the like effects. But there are other depths to ſound.</p>
                  <p>It is requiſite therefore to know that all the Purifications of the Law, which were figures of that Purification which we have by the holy Ghoſt, were wrought either by Water, or by Fire, or by Oil, or by Blood. All things which had need of cleanſing, were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by one of theſe four means.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Water: as it was practiſed in divers occaſions: For we know that waſhings with Water were very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100596:89"/>under the Law. It is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to produce examples.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Fire: as when God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to purifie the ſpoil which they had taken from the Midianites, he ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all that which could endure the Fire, (to wit, Gold, Silver, Braſſe, Iron, Tinne, Lead) ſhould be cleanſed by Fire, <hi>Num.</hi> 31.22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By Oil: as it was obſerved in the Unction of the Prieſts, and that of the leprous, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.16, 17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By Blood: as it is notorious, and we ſhall ſee by and by, that almoſt all things according to the Law are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew that all that which is required to a true Purification, all that which the Law preſcribed to thoſe ends, is found univerſally in the power of the holy Ghoſt; the Scripture repreſenteth it, with its effects, under the name of the matters and all the acts which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Legal Purifications. I might ſpeak of other things concerning this ſubject; but they will come better to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100596:89"/>purpoſe in the doctrine of Baptiſm, for which I reſerve them.</p>

                  <head>A catalogue of thoſe actions which were celebrated with Aſperſion of Blood in the time of the Law.</head>
                  <p>All the Law was written in Blood. The Prieſt, the people, went not but thorow blood. Now to comprehend theſe ſo many different actions in which Blood intervened, it will be to the purpoſe to diſtinguiſh them, and reduce them into ranks or categories. We finde therefore that there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven kindes of actions ſolemnized by the Aſperſion of Blood.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt Paſſeover;</hi> In which the Iſraelites dipped a bunch of hyſop in the blood of the lamb, and marked their doors, to ſerve for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Covenant</hi> treated between God and the people: For after that <hi>Moſes</hi> had rehearſed the Articles, he took the blood of the Sacrifice offered
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100596:90"/>to that effect, and ſprinkled one half on the Altar, and the reſt upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying unto them, <hi>This is the blood of the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Conſecration</hi> of the Tabernacle and of the Prieſts. In this ceremony, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſprinkled with blood the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and all the veſſels of the ſervice: Beſides, he took of the blood from off the Altar, and made an aſperſion upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> upon his ſons, and upon their garments.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Sacrifices,</hi> as well Euchariſtical as Expiatory: For in all Sacrifices the blood was poured all about the Altar of burnt-Offerings: In ſome of them it was alſo put upon the Altar of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: In others there was made an aſperſion before the Vail of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The general Expiation,</hi> which was celebrated once a yeer. In this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, the High Prieſt made an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion of blood, ſeven times, before the Mercy-ſeat, afterward within the Vail, afterward alſo upon the Altar of Incenſe.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100596:90"/>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The purification of the unclean.</hi> The High Prieſt took of the blood of an heifer ſlain for this purpoſe, and ſprinkled it before the Tabernacle; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, the Sacrifice being burned with its blood, and the aſhes reſerved, they were mingled with water, to ſprinkle the tents, the veſſels and the perſons tainted with any uncleanneſſe. This myſtery is opened by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>The ceremonial cleanſing of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous,</hi> as well of houſes as of perſons. A ſparrow was killed, and with his blood the man was ſprinkled that was newly healed of the leproſie. Beſides, they took the blood of a lamb, with which was marked the right ear of the leper, and his hand and his foot. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the leproſie had taken hold of the walls of an houſe, the Prieſt ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them with the blood of a ſparrow, after that the infection was gone.</p>
                  <p>Thus all this multitude of actions performed by ſprinkling of blood, is reduced to the ſeven kindes here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:100596:91"/>
                  <p>Some learned Interpreters ſay very well, that this paſſage beareth an alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the habit of the Prieſts of the Law, who entered not into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but in white robes. The ſenſe then is, that thoſe that are here ſpoken of, which are come out of great tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are made Prieſts unto God, whom they ſerve day and night in his Temple, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. For this Prieſthood with which they are honoured, is expreſſed under the name of the veſtment which the ancient Prieſts wore when they did the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>But the queſtion yet remaineth, How theſe robes are made white in blood. I think therefore that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion denoteth a reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the conſecration of Levitical Prieſts, and that of Chriſtians. When <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons were called to this charge, there were given them Prieſtly gaaments, among the which was the linen robe: but it was not permitted them to approach to the Altar, or to exerciſe any Office in the Tabernacle,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100596:92"/>till they were firſt ſprinkled with blood, both they and their garments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.21. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.30. As therefore the ancient Prieſts were conſecrated by blood, and made capable to wear the Prieſtly habit in the houſe of God; ſo in the vertue of the blood of Chriſt, we are reinveſted of the quality of Prieſts, repreſented by the white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>VVHoſoever ſhall compare the two firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> with the ſixteen laſt of <hi>Exodus,</hi> except the two and thirtieth and the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, ſhall finde a great difference between <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribing the frame of the Univerſe, and <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribing the fabrick of the Tabernacle. In the one, he is very general and ſuccinct: in the other, he is very copious, and ſetteth down even to the ſmalleſt particulars. The deſcription of this great building of the World ſeemed truely to require more words then that of a little pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, which was but an atome in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100596:93"/>of this vaſt extent of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and of the earth: But quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, the Spirit of God having ſhut up and reduced into a little table the whole maſſe of the world, diſplayeth unto us the ſtructure of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in a long and large picture. Now it is very certain that the ſtyle of the Scripture hath its meaſures compaſſed by the circles of a ſoveraign wiſdom. Behold then that which we here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſetting apart many other reaſons which we might bring upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>The world was not built but for the Church, to the end that in it God might be ſerved. The Tabernacle was both a figure of the Church, and the enſigne under which it was aſſembled. God therefore willing to ſhew that his Church, in which his ſervice is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is more precious to him and more conſiderable then all the reſt of the world, hath ſpoken of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle more amply and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly then of all the Elements,

                  <head>The number of perſons that make up the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the univerſal Church is not onely preſixed and definite, but alſo regulated by meaſures and proportions.</head>
                  <p>God is not tied to Numbers, yet nevertheleſſe he doth and diſpoſeth his works by number, weight, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It is obſerved that after the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God cauſed to be numbred all the Iſraelites from the age of twenty yeers and upward (<hi>Exod.</hi> 38.26.) and there were found ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred three thouſand five hundred and fifty men. The yeer following, God commanded to make a ſecond review of the people (<hi>Numb.</hi> 1.46.) but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compriſing the Levites which had been numbred the firſt time with the other Tribes. Notwithſtanding this ſubſtraction, and the caſualties which might have changed the number of the people, ſince the yeer foregoing, it is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100596:94"/>found that their number was yet juſtly and preciſely ſix hundred three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred and fifty men. In which is ſeen a proportion which God held in the multiplication of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There is alſo obſerved a myſtery in the exact number of the two and twenty thouſand Levites which were then reckoned (<hi>Numb.</hi> 3.39) For the reſt, I conteſt not againſt the common opinion, touching the hundred fourty and four thouſand of the ſeventh of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that they ought to be taken for an indefinite number, as well as the ſeven thouſand which had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal:</hi> But it ought to be conſidered why the holy Ghoſt, who ſpeaketh nothing ſuperfluous, is not contented to have named the total ſum of them that were ſealed in Iſrael, but alſo divideth it in twelve times twelve thouſand, diſtributed by equal portions among the twelve Tribes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of which is mentioned the one after the other, with the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its particular number: For this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100596:94"/>ſheweth that the number of the Elect and the multitude of Believers, are meaſured by certain proportions, which are known to him who is the Authour. Certainly, the reſemblance of the ſeventy Diſciples of Chriſt, to the ſeventy Judges which were ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to the ſeventy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which <hi>Jacob</hi> had when he went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> is a line of this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſymmetrie with the which God hath limited and proportioned the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now this fortifieth that Maxime, That the number of the Elect cannot ſuffer addition nor diminution: And, That Election proceedeth not from the will of the Elect, but that of God which prevented them. For can it be ſaid that all the Elect, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to the end, have agreed together to make a company compoſed preciſely of a number certain and regular?</p>

                  <p>The Law, as it is ſufficiently known, diſtinguiſheth the things that were onely holy or ſanctified, from thoſe which were moſt holy, that is to ſay, which ſerved alſo to ſanctifie others. For example; the aromatical confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was uſed for the anointing of the Prieſts; <hi>Item,</hi> all Expiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; certain kindes of Oblations; and the Altar, which ſanctified the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; all theſe things were called <hi>thrice holy, Lev.</hi> 2.3. and 6.14. <hi>Num.</hi> 18.9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. Now it is to be obſerved that the Prieſts onely had the right of touching thoſe things that were <hi>most
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100596:96"/>holy:</hi> This was a priviledge of their Office. The people never touched the Altar, never might uſe an ointment like that of the Prieſts, nor might ever taſte of any Sacrifice of Expiation, as we ſhall ſee when we come to treat of the Supper of the Lord. In ſum, it is a Maxime, That every thing which had the quality of <hi>moſt holy,</hi> was interdicted to the people; which, in this regard, had no communion with the Prieſts. We go not about here to ſound the depth of this myſtery: It ſufficeth us to obſerve that the New Teſtament hath taken away this difference. All Chriſtians at this day are Prieſts, all have received the Prieſtly Unction, all have right to eat that which is <hi>moſt holy,</hi> and which hath the power to ſanctifie, to wit, the Expiatory Sacrifice, that is, the Body of Chriſt.

                  <p>The third, to wit, the Temple, was fixed, founded upon a rock, of ſtrong matter, that promiſed a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: But it was combuſtible, and ſubject to be demoliſhed: As in effect, it was twice overthrown from the top to the bottom.</p>

                  <p>Many excellent conſiderations might be brought upon this ſubject: But principally the Wiſdom of God would ſhew in the moſt notable beginnings, as well of the Iſraelitiſh as the Chriſtian Church, that his Church is a Body di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from all other ſocieties that are in the world, formed upon other principles, of an original quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and that it was not founded upon any terreſtrial Empire.</p>

                  <head>A difference between the Remiſsion which the Law preſented of old to ſinners, and that which is offered unto them by the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>BEhold a point remarkable againſt the Jews, who believe to finde their ſalvation in the Sacrifices and other Ceremonies of the Law, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it ſaith that it ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned unto him who bringeth ſuch or ſuch an Oblation for his ſin. I paſſe by that which is notorious to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that thoſe Legal Expiations had none other quality then that of figures: But that which I obſerve beyond this, is, that the Law it ſelf never preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an univerſal Remiſſion to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This is a Maxime, That the Law had not any Sacrifice which did uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100596:100"/>expiate all the ſins of a man. All the Expiations of which it ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, were but of certain ſins, not of all entirely; and therefore they promiſed a plentary Remiſſion, but ſtill left the ſinner indebted to the Juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this may be objected the Expiation general which was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every yeer on the tenth day of the ſeventh month, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance contained in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. For that beareth expreſly that this ceremony did expiate all the iniquities and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes of the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But we muſt conſider that this Expiation was made but once every yeer, and onely on one day; and it was for ſins precedent, that is to ſay, which had been committed till then. The offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were committed after that day, were not expiated till a yeer after, on the ſame day. So that by the ſpace of a whole yeer, men remained bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with an infinite number of crimes which came upon them after the precedent Expiation, and there needed
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100596:101"/>another, which came not till the yeer was come about. Now how many perſons died before the revolution of the yeer, without being able to attain to the day of Expiation? All thoſe therefore which were prevented by death before that day fell, departed without having obtained an entire Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſince there remained a number of ſins which could not as yet be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated according to the Law.</p>
                  <p>Surely the Law it ſelf ſhewed the impotency of its Expiations, by which there never could be a coming to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Remiſſion. But the Remiſſion which we have by Chriſt, blotteth out univerſally all the ſins of a man that accepteth this pardon. Neither yet is it reſtrained to any circumſtance of place or time. Therefore whereas the Law preſented Remiſſion of ſins but one onely time in a whole yeer, the Goſpel preſenteth it unto us every day.</p>

                  <head>A believer having commited ſome ſin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enormous, is it credible, although he have repented and obtained pardon, that God will love him altogether as much as he loved him before the offence commited?</head>
                  <p>God loveth the righteous; but if
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100596:102"/>the righteous happen to commit ſome great crime, it is impoſſible but God ſhould reſent it. Nevertheleſſe the gate of his Mercy is always open to the penitent. But is there any likelihood that God having been grievouſly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a man whom he loved, will yet love him with ſo great an affection as he loved him before? For he may pardon him, and yet nevertheleſſe abate of his former good will. We pardon often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch an one as hath rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy of the friendſhip which we bare to him, and we may yet have abundance of affection towards him; but it is hard that our affection ſhould return to the ſame degree in which it was before the offence came between, howſoever he teſtifieth his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed for it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this queſtion, we may ſay, That there is more joy in heaven, and conſequently more affection, in ſome regard, for one ſinner coming to repentance, then for ninety and nine righteous, that have no need of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                  <p>We finde four famous among all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom God hath fully reſtored, to wit, a High Prieſt, a Prophet, a King, and one of the firſt Apoſtles.

                  <p>IS this any marvel that ſo great a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch had this belief, ſeeing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians have it, and ſo many Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites had it as well as he? Why is this faith honoured with a greater <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium</hi> in him then in them? We muſt conſider that before the days of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and alſo a long time after, God had not as yet raiſed any dead. This kinde of Miracle was not ſeen till the end of many ages after the deceaſe of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Neither he nor they that had gone before him had ever ſeen or heard, that one that was dead had been raiſed again. As therefore this Miracle was without example, ſo much the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100596:104"/>more of faith was needful to believe that God was able to effect it. But as for us, we have many examples of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, in divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom God reſtored life.

                  <head>An admirable gradation in thoſe which have been raiſed from the dead.</head>
                  <p>The particular Reſurrection of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> and of the others which we read in the Hiſtory, is an image of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſurrection which is to come. In the eſtate of thoſe dead bodies which God hath raiſed at ſeveral times, there are divers degrees.</p>
                  <p>Some have been raiſed incontinently after having given up the Ghoſt, there having not been above ſome few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes between their death and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; as <hi>Acts</hi> 20.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Others had been already fully cold, before they were raiſed; as the ſon of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> as it appeareth by the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100596:105"/>circumſtances related 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.20, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Others had been already waſhed and prepared to the burial; as <hi>Tabitha, Acts</hi> 9.37.</p>
                  <p>Others had been already on the way to the grave; as the ſon of the widow of <hi>Naim,</hi> which was carried out of the Town to be interred, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.12.</p>
                  <p>Others were already entred into the grave; as he which roſe again by the touch of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s bones, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.21.</p>
                  <p>Others had not onely been in the grave, but alſo had ſtayed there, yea, they had been putrified; as <hi>Lazarus, Joh.</hi> 11.39.</p>
                  <p>Others had been reduced to duſt; as thoſe that roſe with Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52.</p>
                  <p>Thus God ſheweth unto us the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in all the conditions of the dead, from them that went no further then expiration, even to them of which there remained no more then duſt. His power which giveth life, hath gone thorow all the paſſages thorow which dead bodies do deſcend
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100596:105"/>to the loweſt degree of their annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>The ſame ſhall come to paſſe in the general Reſurrection: For when the Son of God ſhall call up the dead, there will be found thoſe that have been deceaſed onely ſome few hours ſince, or but a few days; others, that ſhall be already putrified; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſhall have been five or ſix thouſand yeers in the grave, of which there will remain no more but the aſhes.</p>

                  <head>Why there have been more young people raiſed from the dead then old.</head>
                  <p>God hath raiſed from the dead thoſe of both ſexes, and of different ages; as, the daughter of <hi>Fairus,</hi> and <hi>Tabitha;</hi> but the greateſt part have been of young people. The ſon of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sarephta,</hi> and the ſon of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> were as yet in their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The ſon of the widow of <hi>Naim,</hi> was but a youth. The daughter of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100596:106"/>
                     <hi>Jairus</hi> was but twelve yeers old. <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was a young man: And it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſo. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and age of the Saints which came out of their graves when Chriſt aroſe, is not mentioned in the Hiſtory: So much is certain, that among all them whom it nameth, the number of young people raiſed from the dead is greater then that of aged perſons, of whom we have none but <hi>Tobitha,</hi> and it may be him that was raiſed in the grave of <hi>Eliſha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this alſo is a ſhort table or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the great Reſurrection which is to be at the laſt Day: For that ſhall raiſe far more young people then old. This needeth no demonſtration. The number of them that die young, hath ſtill ſurpaſſed the number of them that die old. How many human creatures die in their childhood, or in their growth, or in the flower of their age? Thoſe that go beyond all thoſe firſt ſeaſons of their life, and arrive as far as the laſt, are very few in compariſon of them whom
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100596:106"/>death intercepteth in the way. As therefore the number of the younger ſort is the greater among the dead, ſo alſo it ſhall be the greater in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead. And to repreſent this to us, God would, by a myſterious Preludium, raiſe more of young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then of old.</p>

               <head>Of the <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> and of the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> mentioned <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. And from whence thoſe terms are extracted.</head>
               <p>THis paſſage hath divers difficulties: For it ſpeaketh of a term of a thouſand yeers, during which the Saints muſt raign with Chriſt. It is alſo ſaid, that the reſt of the dead are not to riſe till thoſe thouſand yeers be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; and this is the <hi>firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:100596:107"/>Concerning which the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours both ancient and modern have very different opinions: And many, renewing the opinion of the Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, figure to themſelves a bodily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the faithful, which they believe muſt precede by many ages the Reſurrection of other men.</p>
               <p>Now I will not contradict the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expoſition which beareth that by the <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> is meant the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, by which we riſe again into newneſſe of life; And by the <hi>ſecond Death,</hi> that which is otherwiſe called <hi>eternal.</hi> But that which I have to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here, is, that theſe terms <hi>(the firſt Reſurrection, the ſecond death)</hi> carry with them an excellent alluſion which is not conſidered, though it be very viſible, and that it giveth abundance of light in the obſcurity of this text.</p>
               <p>This therefore is to be noted, that according to the literal conſtruction of theſe words, there are two Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The one, which is or already hath been performed in this world;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100596:107"/>the other, which is to be at the laſt day. The one is particular, the other is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. Now this is true hiſtorically and really: For <hi>Lazarus, Eutychus, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitha,</hi> and divers others mentioned in Scripture, have been already raiſed once, (this is the <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi>) and ſhall yet be raiſed once more, to wit, in the end of the world, with the reſt of the dead. So that they have two Reſurrections, having already paſſed thorow the firſt.</p>
               <p>This alluſion is extended yet farther. It is ſaid touching them that have part in this <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> that the <hi>ſecond death</hi> hath no power over them. Upon which, it is to be conſidered that it is never ſaid that <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or any of all them which were raiſed from the dead, died the ſecond time. It is very true that they died again: for Chriſt is the firſt of them that roſe to immortality. Nevertheleſſe the Scripture, which is ſo exact to ſet down all that which is worthy of conſideration, never rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſecond death of them which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100596:108"/>have been raiſed, no not of one of them. It did import, as it ſhould ſeem, to know ſo much the conſequents and the effects of the divine power which reſtored them to life, that we ſhould know whether they lived any long time after they were raiſed from the dead. Yet their <hi>ſecond death</hi> is not read in the Scripture. A ſilence ſo conſtant and univerſal, as well in the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teſtament, is not without ſome great ground.</p>
               <p>I think therefore that this omiſſion is myſterious, as divers others which are ſeen in the Scripture. There is no doubt but that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> died, as well as other men: Yet, as every one knoweth, he is ſaid to be <hi>without end of life,</hi> Heb. 7.3. That is to ſay, in as much as he is preſented as ſuch in the holy Hiſtory, the which reciteth not either the birth or the deceaſe of this perſon, but rather produceth him as a man eternal. Accordingly, howſoever thoſe that have been raiſed, have been returned to the grave, yet this is not
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100596:108"/>expreſſed. The Scripture after having raiſed them, leaveth them as living for ever, without ever ſaying that they died afterward: So that their <hi>ſecond death</hi> is not found. Where therefore it is ſpoken, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. of thoſe which have part in the firſt Reſurrection, that the ſecond death hath no power over them; it is evident that this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is drawn from the hiſtory of them whom we read to have been raiſed from the dead, which is the <hi>firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> but we read not that they died the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>Thus the Spirit of God draweth matters Hiſtorical, to frame the images of future events which it ſetteth to view in Prophecies. This Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is all compoſed of ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, whereof the ſtuff and colours are borrowed of that which hath come to paſſe really according to the letter, but animated with a ſpiritual and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſe: For it doth not follow that that which is literally in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, ought to be underſtood literally
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100596:109"/>in Prophecie: On the contrary, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth one thing by another quite different, though there be a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of one to the other. Theſe Prophetick terms, <hi>that the ſecond death hath no power over them which have a part in the firſt Reſurrection,</hi> expreſſe formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hiſtory of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the reſt which already have had one Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which we read not to have been followed by a ſecond death. Shall we therefore yet expect that ſome ſhall be raiſed before the laſt Day, yea a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers before? By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it will be requiſite that we expect two men which ſhall have power to ſhut up heaven, to hinder that it rain not, to turn waters into blood, to ſmite the earth with all plagues, to conſume their enemies with fire coming forth of their mouth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.5, 6. But this, if we take it literally, is as abſurd as if we would make <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to come again; for this Prophecie is moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon their hiſtory. By the ſame reaſon, we muſt imagine Jaſpers, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſts,

And by the ſame reaſon, we muſt rebuild the Altar and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which repreſent the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.</p>

                     <hi>Why Saint Paul being come back from the third heaven, ſpeaketh not of having Seen, but onely of having Heard,</hi> 2 Cor. 14.4.</head>
                  <p>It may be that in effect he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thither rather to Hear then to See. And this, Either becauſe being yet mortal, God revealed himſelf to him as to <hi>Moſes;</hi> not by the ſight of his face, of which every man living is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, but by the words of his mouth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18, &amp;c. Or becauſe being to deſcend yet from heaven hither below,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100596:112"/>to inſtruct others, he had need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtructions, and by conſequence, it was more neceſſary for him to Hear then to See, more profitable both to him and to thoſe that were afterward taught by him. For howſoever the words which he had heard, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, yet they furniſhed him with great lights, the which he forgot not, but brought them from above, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten both himſelf and others.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Two onely things at which Jeſus Chriſt as man wondered.</head>
                  <p>THe one was the <hi>Unbelief</hi> of his country-men the <hi>Galileans, Mark</hi> 6.6. The other was the <hi>Faith</hi> of a ſtranger, to wit, the Centurion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.10. We read not that Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100596:112"/>in the days of his humiliation, ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired any thing but theſe two. It is truely a thing to be admired, that many are unbelievers in a greater light, and that many have a great faith, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened but by a little ſpark.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of a ſtrange method by which God obligeth men to believe.</head>
                  <p>It were an impertinency and folly for one man to ſay to another, <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee to believe this:</hi> for Belief is not formed by Commandment, but by Perſwaſion. None is maſter of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of another, no not of his own: For a man cannot Believe all that he would, yea, he is often conſtrained to believe that which he would not; as the devils believe, againſt their will, that there is a God. The object of Belief is not Imperative, but Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; nor is it propoſed in form of a Commandment, but in that of a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe, God doth not onely
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100596:113"/>invite us to Believe, in preſenting to us the Truths which are the objects of our Faith, but himſelf commandeth us: <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould Believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. Upon which we ought to conſider, that in commanding to believe, he can cauſe us to believe. His words, when it pleaſeth him to animate them with his Spirit, plant Faith in the heart of man. Nor doth it import that they be narrative or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitive, or otherwiſe conceived: For their efficacy dependeth not upon the form of the expreſſions, but upon the ſecret vertue of their Author. It were a great impropriety every way, if a man ſhould command me to believe; for with all his commandments he cannot cauſe me to believe, as long as my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit perſwadeth me to the contrary. But God, who is the Father and the Maſter of ſpirits, can ſpeak in the terms of Commanding; becauſe in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Believe, in effect he giveth the grace to Believe. So that language,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100596:113"/>which were abſurd in the mouth of man, is admirable in the mouth of God.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of thoſe that promiſe to Believe, if the truth be ſhewn unto them.</head>
                  <p>There is nothing more ordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which diſpute againſt the true Religion, then theſe words, <hi>Prove me that which ye ſay, and I will believe it.</hi> But theſe people ſpeak as if Faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depended upon themſelves. They promiſe that which is not in their power. This is as if a blinde man ſhould promiſe to know colours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be ſhewed unto him. The Truth, what evidence ſoever it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it, is not perceptible but to him that hath eyes capable of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Now this viſive faculty is not given to all; although all preſume that they have it.</p>
                  <p>I will not here ſpeak of them who imagine that if they ſaw ſome Miracle, they ſhould undoubtedly believe: Nor
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100596:114"/>of them who think they have a great Faith, becauſe they never doubted of any point of Religion: Nor of the learned, why they are more ſubject to doubts then the common ſort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Nor of other matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this ſubject, which I have touched in my Treatiſe of <hi>Popular Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi>
